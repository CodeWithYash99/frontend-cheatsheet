const createObjects = `
  1. Object Literal (most common):
    const obj = {
      name: "Alice",
      age: 25
    };

  2. Using new Object() Constructor:
    const obj = new Object();
    obj.name = "Bob";
    obj.age = 30;

  3. Using Object.create() (prototype-based creation):          
    const proto = {

    const obj = Object.create(proto);
    obj.name = "Eve"; 
    obj.greet(); // Output: Hello!

  4. Using a Constructor Function:                                  
    function Person(name, age) {                                  
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    const person1 = new Person("Charlie", 35);

  5. Using ES6 class Syntax:
    class Person {
      constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    }

    const person2 = new Person("Diana", 28);

  6. Using Factory Functions (functions that return objects):
    function createPerson(name, age) {
      return {
        name,
        age,
        greet() {
          console.log(\`Hi, I am \${name}\`);
        }
      };
    }

    const person3 = createPerson("Frank", 40);
    person3.greet(); // Hi, I am Frank

          JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that adds
          interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. While HTML defines
          the structure and CSS handles the styling, JavaScript controls how a
          page behaves — things like handling user interactions, updating the
          DOM in real time, and communicating with APIs.
        </p>
        <p className="ans-para">
          In front-end development, JavaScript is essential for creating
          responsive, interactive user experiences. Modern JavaScript (ES6 and
          later) introduces features like arrow functions, modules, promises,
          and async/await, which can make the code more efficient and readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use JavaScript with frameworks and libraries like React to
          build component-based UIs and manage application state more
          effectively.

          When a browser loads a web page, it first parses the HTML to build the
          DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS to build the CSSOM.
        </li>
        <li>
          When it encounters JavaScript, the JavaScript engine takes over. The
          engine parses the JS code, compiles it into machine code using
          Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, and then executes it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The browser also has a call stack, heap, and event loop to manage
          synchronous and asynchronous tasks. Through the Web APIs (like
          setTimeout, fetch, or DOM manipulation), JavaScript interacts with the
          browser environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, any changes to the DOM or CSSOM trigger the browser’s
          rendering pipeline — which handles layout, painting, and compositing —
          to update what the user sees on the screen.

          <b>innerText:</b> Returns the visible text content of an element,
          taking into account CSS styles like display and visibility. It
          triggers a reflow to compute the visible text.

        <p>
          - It’s commonly used to copy arrays, merge arrays or objects, and pass

          - It is used in function parameters to gather remaining arguments that

        <p>
          - Developers often use tools like <b>Babel</b> or libraries like{" "}

          JavaScript can be faster than server-side rendering in certain

        <p>
